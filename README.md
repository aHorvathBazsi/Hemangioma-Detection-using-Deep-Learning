# Hemangioma-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
The repository contains code in form of jupyter notebook for the followings:
- Generate crops from the original image
- Shuffle a directory
- Implement binary classification (using Pytorch framework) of the crops using a Convolutional Neural Network (will be updated soon)
