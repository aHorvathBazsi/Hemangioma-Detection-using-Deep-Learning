# Hemangioma-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
The repository contains 3 different parts of the proiect, having the following roles:
- Generate crops from the original image
- Shuffle a directory
- Implement binary classification (using Pytorch framework) of the crops using a Convolutional Neural Network
